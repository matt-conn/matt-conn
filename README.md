👋 Greetings!
<br />My name is Matt Connolly. At my day job, I am the Head of Sales at an electronics recycling company in the United States. I'm proud to have helped divert over 5,000,000 pounds of electronics from the landfill. I also have a passion for woodworking, coaching, reading, and CrossFit.
